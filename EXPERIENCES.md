## Coordinate System

- World → Three.js transform: `threeX = worldX − worldHalf`, `threeZ = worldY − worldHalf`, `threeY = worldZ`.
- Collision-test map is **non-square (819 × 828 after 50% scale-up)**. Always use `width/2` for X offsets and `height/2` for Y/Z offsets. Reusing `width/2` for Z causes slope-support drift and airborne-state issues.

### Scaling the exported 3D map (50% scale-up, 2026-04-12)
The map is a coupled system — all of these must stay in sync when scaling:
1. `MAP_SCALE` in both `exportedMapCollision.ts` (backend) and `ExportedMapScene.tsx` (frontend): the GLB group scale factor.
2. `GROUP_POS_X/Y/Z` in both files: scale linearly by the same factor as MAP_SCALE (they're in Three.js world units derived from the scale).
3. `EXPORTED_MAP_WIDTH/HEIGHT` (backend `exportedMap.ts`) and `COLLISION_TEST_MAP_WIDTH/HEIGHT` (frontend `collisionTestMap.ts`): the world boundary.
4. All entity AABBs in `exportedMap.ts` and `collisionTestMap.ts`: x, y, w, d, h all scale proportionally.
5. Spawn positions in `exportedMap.ts` → `EXPORTED_MAP_SPAWN_POSITIONS`: scale x, y by the same factor.
The BVH collision triangles in the GLBs do NOT change — only the coordinate mapping constants change.

---

## CORS / Nginx

- Using an external URL in `BACKEND_URL` causes nginx 404 — always point to `http://localhost:5000` for server-side calls.
- WebSocket proxy requires `http/1.1 + Upgrade + Connection` headers, or the connection silently fails.
- Missing `Host` header in nginx proxy causes cookie routing failures.

---

## Mongoose Mixed Fields

- Mongoose does not track nested property mutations on `Mixed` fields.  
  Solution: reassign the whole object using spread (`{ ...obj, prop: newVal }`) and call `markModified()` on both parent path and specific nested path before `save()`.

---

## Collision System (collision-test mode)

- Player radius for collision-test: **0.64** (authoritative, set in `GameLoop.ts`).
- Ground support radius must be tight (≈ playerRadius + small epsilon); too large causes "floating on air" near edges.
- Side-collision Z gating must be consistent with ground-support epsilon, or players bounce/get rejected on rooftops.
- Critical broadphase rule: every spatial query must use the segment bounds (min/max of sx/sy/ex/ey), not legacy x/y/w/d, or you get invisible blockers / walk-through colliders.

---

## Dashing Abilities

### Dash in collision-test mode bypassed BVH (FIXED)
- **Bug**: During `activeDash` in `movement.ts`, horizontal collision used `resolveObjectCollision` (AABB) instead of `resolveExportedHorizontalCollision` (BVH). Vertical ground snapping used `getGroundHeight` (AABB) instead of `getExportedGroundHeight` (BVH).
- **Symptom**: In collision-test mode, dashes could clip through BVH-only walls; terrain height wasn't followed during dashes; player floated above/clipped into terrain while dashing.
- **Fix**: In the `activeDash` block of `movement.ts`, now uses `hasExportedCollision(mapCtx)` to switch between BVH and AABB collision for both horizontal and vertical handling.
- **Files**: `backend/game/engine/loop/movement.ts`

### 疾 ability visual "collision with opponent" in frontend
- **Root cause**: Was caused by AABB building collision during dash (entity-level AABBs in exportedMap.objects include entity_13 right at spawn, h=4.62). Small AABB buildings were stopping the dash via `resolveObjectCollision`, causing the player to appear to bounce. Fixed by the above BVH dash fix.
- The BVH system passes through thin obstacles correctly instead of bouncing.

---

## LOS / Vision Checks

### Small terrain-level objects falsely blocking LOS (FIXED)
- **Bug**: `isLOSBlocked` and `isLOSBlockedClient` checked ALL AABB objects, including tiny ground-level props in the exported map (e.g., h=2.84, h=2.96, h=3.04, h=3.72, h=3.82, h=4.62, h=5.76). The map floor is 3D terrain, so these objects represent ground bumps that players can stand on, not walls.
- **Symptom**: In collision-test mode, targeting abilities showed "视线被建筑遮挡" even when the path was open. Channel spells cancelled immediately on slightly uneven ground.
- **Also found**: `validateAction.ts` was hardcoded to `worldMap.objects` for LOS regardless of game mode — this is now fixed to use the correct map via `options.mapObjects`.
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `minBlockH` parameter to `isLOSBlocked` (backend) and `isLOSBlockedClient` (frontend). Objects with h < 5.5 game units are now ignored as LOS blockers.
  - Added `casterZ` / `targetZ` parameters: if both players' feet are at or above the object's top, the object doesn't block (handles elevated terrain).
  - In collision-test mode, `minLOSBlockH = 5.5` is passed at all call sites.
  - `validateCastAbility` now receives `mapObjects` and `minLOSBlockH` via options (set by `playService.ts` from `loop.getMapCtx()`).
  - Added `GameLoop.getMapCtx()` public method.
- **Files**: `backend/game/engine/loop/GameLoop.ts`, `backend/game/engine/rules/validateAction.ts`, `backend/game/services/gameplay/playService.ts`, `frontend/app/game/screens/in-game/components/BattleArena/BattleArena.tsx`

### LOS still false-blocking at range — eye-height + AABB-inside fix (2025)
- **Root cause**: Entity-level AABBs in the exported map over-approximate reality. E.g., entity_0 (h=135, 89×115 footprint) covers a huge area including open spaces players stand in.
- **Two new filters added** (both backend + frontend):
  1. **Eye-height**: Object is skipped if `obj.h <= Math.min(casterZ + 1.5, targetZ + 1.5)`. Objects shorter than both players' eye heights can't block LOS.
  2. **Player-inside-AABB**: If either player is standing inside the object's 2D footprint (point-in-AABB check), the object is skipped. This handles the over-large AABB problem where players in open areas within a building's bounding box should not be blocked by that building.
- **Return type changes**: `isLOSBlocked()` now returns `string | null` (blocking entity id or null). `isLOSBlockedClient()` returns `MapObject | null`.
- **Debug overlay added**: When a cast fails with LOS blocked, a red overlay shows the blocking entity ID and bounds. A wireframe red box highlights it in the 3D scene.
- **Backend logging**: `validateAction.ts` now logs `[LOS] blocked by entity_X (casterZ=N targetZ=N)` for server-side debugging.
- **Files**: Same + `frontend/app/game/screens/in-game/components/BattleArena/scene/ArenaScene.tsx`

---

## Build / Deployment

- Build order: backend first (`npm run build`), then frontend (`npm run build`), then `pm2 restart all`.
- If a port is stuck: `lsof -ti:PORT | xargs kill -9`, then `pm2 restart all`.
- Never edit `.ts` files and expect changes to appear without rebuilding — ts-node compiles only at startup.

---

## Mobile Controls

### Virtual joystick for touch devices
- **Implementation**: `VirtualJoystick.tsx` — analog circular joystick using `React.TouchEvent`, tracks single touch ID, fires `onDirectionChange` (WASD booleans for keysRef) and `onAnalogMove` (dx/dy for smooth server-side movement).
- **Mobile detection**: `navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0 && !window.matchMedia('(pointer: fine)').matches` — detects phones/iPads without a fine pointer (mouse). Auto-switches `controlMode` to 'joystick' on first load if mobile is detected.
- **Jump button**: Integrated as a separate touch circle next to the joystick.
- **Analog movement**: `joystickDirRef.current` stores the latest normalized (dx, dy). In `sendMovement`, joystick mode now sends `{dx, dy, jump}` directly when the joystick is active (same as traditional mode's precise direction vector). The backend `MovementInput` interface already supports optional `dx/dy` overrides.
- **Files**: `VirtualJoystick.tsx` (rewritten), `BattleArena.tsx`

### Touch camera rotation (iPad/iPhone)
- **Implementation**: A `useEffect` in `BattleArena.tsx` adds `touchstart/touchmove/touchend` on `window`, matching the touch to a finger that started inside `wrapRef` (the 3D canvas div). Swipe rotates camera + player facing (same as PC right-click drag).
- **Critical**: Joystick's `onTouchStart` uses `e.preventDefault()` so it captures its own touches before the canvas-level listener sees them.
- **Lesson**: Touch listeners for camera must be `passive: true` on `window`, but this means we can't call `preventDefault` to block scroll. Use `touch-action: none` on the `.container` CSS class and `document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden'` in a `useEffect` to prevent page scroll.
- **Joystick position**: Expressed as `left: '70%', bottom: '60%', transform: 'translate(-50%, 50%)'` — must use CSS % strings, not pixel integers, for proper screen-relative placement.
- **Files**: `BattleArena.tsx`, `BattleArena.module.css`

## Frontend Client-Side BVH LOS

### Real-time ability LOS indicator without server round-trip
- **Problem**: In collision-test mode, AABB `isLOSBlockedClient` was disabled (mode guard `!== 'collision-test'`), so abilities targeting an opponent behind a wall showed no indicator until server rejection.
- **Solution**: Added `MapCollisionSystem.checkLOS(from, to, radius)` using the same BVH raycast as the existing `shellBVH`. Added `clientCheckLOS()` helper in `BattleArena.tsx` that converts game coordinates to BVH space using the same formula as the backend (`ExportedMapCollisionSystem.checkLOS`).
- **Coordinate transform**: `x = (px - halfW - GROUP_POS_X) / RENDER_SF`, `y = (pz + 1.5 - GROUP_POS_Y) / RENDER_SF`, `z = (halfH - py - GROUP_POS_Z) / RENDER_SF`.
- **LOS eye height**: `1.5` game units added to Z (height) so the ray shoots from chest-level, not floor-level.
- **Result**: Abilities now gray out with red glow border in real time when target is behind a BVH wall. Blueprint mode shows a green/red line to the target.
- **Files**: `MapCollisionSystem.ts`, `BattleArena.tsx`, `ArenaScene.tsx`

### Legacy "ghost" AABB entities blocking LOS (the root breakthrough)
- **Root cause was NOT a ground/terrain problem**: The original complaint "opponent near a house blocks vision" was caused by the old AABB entity bounding boxes (e.g., `entity_73`, `entity_74`). These AABBs are massively over-approximate — they cover entire courtyard areas including places the player stands. When targeting from "inside" one AABB, the AABB check always failed.
- **Disproved approach**: Spent time trying `minBlockH` filters and eye-height filters on the AABB path — partial fix but still wrong for large AABBs.
- **Actual fix**: Switch LOS entirely to BVH raycast in collision-test mode, both client and backend. The BVH uses actual triangle geometry (exported from the 3D map via Three.js BVH), so it is always accurate. AABB checks are now only used as fallback for non-collision-test modes.
- **Key insight**: The frontend blueprint wireframe mode (cyan collision mesh) and the BVH raycast use identical geometry → if the line in blueprint mode passes through open space, the ability should be castable.
- **Files**: `exportedMapCollision.ts` (backend), `MapCollisionSystem.ts` (frontend)

---

## Dash Wall Tunneling

### Fast dashes clipping through walls (FIXED)
- **Bug**: During `activeDash`, horizontal movement was applied in one large step (~1.23 game units/tick for 疾). BVH collision only resolved at the final position, not along the path.
- **Symptom**: 疾 and 蹑云逐月 could dash straight through BVH walls that were thinner than the dash step size.
- **Fix**: Added sub-stepping in `movement.ts` for dash XY movement. Max sub-step = `playerRadius × 0.85 ≈ 0.544u`. `疾` → ~3 sub-steps/tick, `蹑云逐月` → ~2 sub-steps/tick. Each sub-step applies partial XY, clamps arena bounds, and runs full BVH collision resolution.
- **Files**: `backend/game/engine/loop/movement.ts`

---

## Debug/Display Cleanup

### AABB "Part Boxes" button replaced with BVH mesh
- The "Part Boxes" orange AABB debug display was inaccurate (over-approximate boxes). Replaced with the actual BVH shell mesh (`showCollisionShells`). The "Shell+Probe" and "Part Boxes" buttons were merged into a single "碰撞体" button that toggles the BVH wireframe.
- **Key insight**: Never use AABB for visual collision debugging in collision-test mode — the real collision uses BVH, so the debug display should too.
- **Files**: `BattleArena.tsx`, `ArenaScene.tsx`, `ExportedMapScene.tsx`

### `instanceId` undefined crash in commonUpdated map
- **Bug**: In the `commonUpdated` `.map()` block, the return object referenced `instanceId` which is a `const` declared inside the sibling `draftUpdated` block — not in scope.
- **Fix**: Common abilities use `ability.id` as their stable ID (they have no per-instance ID).
- **Lesson**: Code copying between the draft and common ability map blocks must be careful about scope. Always check what `const` variables are actually declared in the current block.

### Export-reader sunlight is not static (collision-test lighting)
- **Root cause**: The export-reader `DirectionalLight` is not just a fixed light with `intensity=3`, color, and shadow settings. Every frame it re-centers the sun around the camera and moves the light target to the camera position:
  `sun.position = camera.position + dir * 100000`, `sun.target.position = camera.position`.
- **Why this matters**: Copying only the numeric light props into collision-test mode is not enough. A static world-space sun can make the scene look wrong and break shadow coverage, even when the light color/intensity look identical on paper.
- **Lesson**: When matching export-reader visuals, compare the full runtime behavior, not just the constructor arguments. Renderer state, per-frame light updates, and material/shader setup all matter.

### Export-reader fill lights use linear colors, not hex approximations
- **Bug**: Collision-test mode initially recreated export-reader ambient/hemisphere lights with hex strings like `#7f7f7f` and `#667299`. Export-reader does **not** get those colors from sRGB hex — it gets them from linear float arrays in `environment.json` (`ambientColor`, `skyLightColor * skyColorMultiplier`).
- **Symptom**: With only ambient/hemi enabled the scene looked like a dark "6pm" fill, and when the directional sun turned on it overwhelmed the scene like a floodlight because the fill lights were much darker than export-reader.
- **Fix**: Use exact linear `THREE.Color(r, g, b)` values for ambient and hemisphere sky lights in collision-test mode. This keeps the sun/fill balance consistent with export-reader.

### Remaining export-reader parity gaps after sun matching
- **Camera mismatch**: export-reader camera is `PerspectiveCamera(60, aspect, 20, 500000)` with orbit distance `220..1800` and camera height `120`. Collision-test gameplay camera is a different rig entirely (`fov=72`, `near=0.5`, default `far=2000`, third-person follow camera with `CAM_DIST_BACK=20`, `CAM_HEIGHT=10`). The same sunlight will read differently under a very different camera/framing setup.
- **Renderer mismatch**: export-reader creates `WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true, powerPreference: 'high-performance', logarithmicDepthBuffer: true })` and caps pixel ratio to `min(devicePixelRatio, 1.5)`. Collision-test currently only sets `antialias: true` on the R3F canvas. This can affect depth precision and overall visual response on large terrain.
- **Takeaway**: If a scene must look exactly like export-reader, matching the light alone is insufficient. Camera model and renderer construction are part of the visual pipeline.

### Centralize test UI behind one hotkey panel
- **Problem**: Floating debug/test widgets piled up on screen and interfered with visual comparison work.
- **Fix**: Moved env toggles + sun controls into a centered testing panel opened by `F8`, with section-level show/hide toggles so future tools can live in one place.
- **Default policy**: Keep the testing UI hidden by default, but preserve useful debug controls behind the hotkey instead of deleting them.

### Use `Esc` as the primary in-game testing/debug panel hotkey
- **Problem**: The testing panel was on `F8` only, while the user expected an `Esc` panel. Existing top-right widgets (`碰撞体`, `Blueprint`, `XY%`, control mode gear) were still scattered outside the panel.
- **Fix**: `Esc` now toggles the centered debug panel. The panel now contains environment toggles, sun config, live XYZ position, movement/combat status, collision/grid toggles, and control mode settings.
- **Current input policy**: Keep `Esc` for the panel, but leave the original camera zoom behavior on the mouse wheel. Avoid piling extra debug bindings onto unrelated gameplay keys unless explicitly requested.

### Height / jump HUD must be floor-relative, not absolute-Z
- **Bug**: The frontend jump HUD tracked takeoff/landing with `Z > 0.01` / `Z <= 0.01`, which only works when the current floor is world Z=0. Rooftop jumps never measured correctly, and peak height was reported in absolute world Z instead of height above the floor the player jumped from.
- **Fix**: Track jump state from `currentZ - groundBelowMe`, store the floor height at takeoff, and report peak jump height as `(peakZ - takeoffFloor) / 2.2` in new units. This also keeps the live `A | B` HUD correct on rooftops.
- **Files**: `frontend/app/game/screens/in-game/components/BattleArena/BattleArena.tsx`

### Double-jump prediction can feel wrong even when jump constants match
- **Root cause**: The client and backend jump constants already matched. The visible snap came from frontend Z reconciliation being too aggressive immediately after a local jump input, especially on double jump where the server naturally lags the client by about one movement tick.
- **Fix**: Keep the same jump physics, but soften in-air Z reconciliation. Briefly trust local prediction more after a jump press, use larger airborne snap thresholds, and avoid zeroing vertical velocity unless the player is effectively grounded.
- **Files**: `frontend/app/game/screens/in-game/components/BattleArena/BattleArena.tsx`

### Unit rescale mistake: ability-layer distances were scaled when only locomotion needed scaling
- **Mistake**: Dash distance, cast range, and knockback were multiplied by `2.2` on top of the locomotion rescale. That made abilities travel/check farther than the user intended.
- **Fix**: Keep the `2.2` conversion only in movement/jump physics. Remove it from `DirectionalDash.ts`, `Dash.ts`, `validateAction.ts`, and `GameLoop.ts` knockback so ability numbers remain literal.
- **Files**: `backend/game/engine/effects/definitions/DirectionalDash.ts`, `backend/game/engine/effects/definitions/Dash.ts`, `backend/game/engine/rules/validateAction.ts`, `backend/game/engine/loop/GameLoop.ts`, `backend/game/engine/loop/movement.ts`

### Explicit steer-dash speeds can still be old-scale even after dash-distance rollback
- **Bug**: `踏星行` and `穹隆化生` were still using authored `speedPerTick` values like `0.4166667`, which are old-scale movement units per tick. After removing the broader dash-distance scaling, those two became obviously too slow.
- **Attempted fix (later reverted)**: Scaling authored `speedPerTick` through `UNIT_SCALE` in `movement.ts` made `踏星行` far too fast. The correct resolution is to keep authored `speedPerTick` literal and retune per-ability values where needed.
- **Audit result**: Frontend has no separate active-dash physics for the local player; active dashes are server-authoritative. Jump prediction in `BattleArena.tsx` still mirrors backend jump constants and was not double-scaled the way dash/range had been.
- **Files**: `backend/game/engine/loop/movement.ts`, `backend/game/abilities/abilities.ts`, `frontend/app/game/screens/in-game/components/BattleArena/BattleArena.tsx`

### Correction: explicit steer-dash `speedPerTick` values are literal authored units
- **Correction**: The runtime `movement.ts` scaling above was wrong for authored `speedPerTick`. `踏星行` should stay at `12.5 u/s` (`0.4166667` per tick) with no extra runtime multiplier, while `穹隆化生` should be authored directly as `33 units / 2 seconds = 0.55` per tick.
- **Requested tuning**: `疾` reverted to a `1s` dash, and `散流霞` now completes its `10-unit` forward dash in `0.5s`.
- **Files**: `backend/game/engine/loop/movement.ts`, `backend/game/abilities/abilities.ts`

### Uneven exported terrain can sink flat ground-effect visuals below the floor
- **Bug**: AOE rings/discs for effects like `穹隆化生`, `风来吴山`, `狂龙乱舞`, and `百足` were rendered at raw `zone.z` / `player.z`, so on non-flat exported terrain parts of the visual could clip underground.
- **Fix**: In `ArenaScene.tsx`, clamp effect visuals to the local support ground under the zone center in `collision-test` mode and add a small vertical lift so the full animation stays above the floor.
- **Files**: `frontend/app/game/screens/in-game/components/BattleArena/scene/ArenaScene.tsx`, `frontend/app/game/screens/in-game/components/BattleArena/BattleArena.tsx`

### Exported-map ground casts need their own pointer surface
- **Bug**: `百足` ground-cast stopped working after switching to the exported collision-test map because `ArenaScene` only forwarded pointer events through the old flat `Ground` component. The exported-map path rendered no interactive cast surface, so ground preview/click never fired.
- **Fix**: Add pointer props to `ExportedMapScene` and attach them to an invisible-but-raycastable plane sized to the map. This restores ground-target preview and click casting for abilities like `百足` in collision-test mode.
- **Files**: `frontend/app/game/screens/in-game/components/BattleArena/scene/ExportedMapScene.tsx`, `frontend/app/game/screens/in-game/components/BattleArena/scene/ArenaScene.tsx`

### Base movement must be normalized across all control modes
- **Bug**: Traditional mode already sent normalized `dx/dy`, but the backend boolean-input path summed `up/down/left/right` directly. That made joystick/boolean diagonal movement faster than the intended base speed.
- **Fix**: Normalize boolean movement vectors in `movement.ts` before multiplying by `effectiveMoveSpeed`. The configured base move speed remains `0.3666667` world units per tick, which is exactly `5.0` new units per second after dividing by `2.2` and multiplying by `30Hz`.
- **Testing method**: Add a `Base Move Speed Test` widget in `BattleArena.tsx` that shows configured base speed, live measured speed, and a base-only capture that ignores dash / jump / speed-buff samples.
- **Files**: `backend/game/engine/loop/movement.ts`, `frontend/app/game/screens/in-game/components/BattleArena/BattleArena.tsx`

## Unit Rescale (2026-04-14)

### Problem
Maps imported from real games have a different scale than our original arena. Measurement confirmed: a specific house is 22 units tall in our world and 10 units in the reference game → ratio = 2.2. Without rescaling, the player moves too slowly across the map and attack/dash ranges feel short.

### Solution — `UNIT_SCALE = 2.2` (1 new unit = 2.2 old world units)
All game-design values (move speed, jump heights, dash distances, ranges, knockback) stay the same **numbers** in abilities.ts and configs. The physics/validation code multiplies by `UNIT_SCALE = 2.2` at every point where a design value is converted to a world-coordinate displacement.

### Files changed
| File | What changed |
|---|---|
| `backend/game/engine/loop/movement.ts` | Added `UNIT_SCALE=2.2`; all GRAVITY/VZ jump constants now include `×2.2`; `AIR_NUDGE_TOTAL_DISTANCE = 1 × 2.2`; dead zones for dash angle capture scaled ×2.2; `snapUpUnits` and `diveVzPerTick` multiplied by `UNIT_SCALE` at apply-time |
| `backend/game/services/battle/battleService.ts` | `moveSpeed: 0.1666667 → 0.3666667` |
| `backend/game/routes/draft.routes.ts` | Same moveSpeed update |
| `backend/game/engine/effects/definitions/DirectionalDash.ts` | Added `UNIT_SCALE`; `worldDistance = distance × 2.2` used for `vxPerTick`, `vyPerTick`, angle caps, arc peak height, route-damage endpoint, and route radius |
| `backend/game/engine/effects/definitions/Dash.ts` | Added `UNIT_SCALE`; stop distance 1→2.2 world units; dash speed ×2.2 |
| `backend/game/engine/rules/validateAction.ts` | Added `UNIT_SCALE`; range check: `distance > ability.range × 2.2`; minRange check: `distance < ability.minRange × 2.2` |
| `backend/game/engine/loop/GameLoop.ts` | `knockbackUnits` multiplied by `UNIT_SCALE` (inline constant) before applying to position |
| `frontend/app/game/screens/in-game/components/BattleArena/BattleArena.tsx` | `MAX_SPEED` and all GRAVITY/VZ prediction constants scaled ×2.2; `AIR_NUDGE_TOTAL_DISTANCE = 2.2`; fallback `baseMoveSpeed` updated |

### Key principle
**Never change the numbers in abilities.ts** (range: 20, value: 1.7, etc.). Only scale at the physics/validation boundary. This way the design intent is readable in one place and the scale factor is in one constant (`UNIT_SCALE = 2.2`).
